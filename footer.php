  While writing this I went over the time allotted, but couldn't exactly turn in a half complete test. This project is extensible and uses the simplest code ( no external libraries ) to be a standalone application if needed. It also has the ability to provide more than one calendar, though the execution of calendar to calendar comparisons was not implemented due to time constraints.
